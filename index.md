This resource introduces Python for Arts and Humanities (A&H) Research by providing a comprehensive overview of Python's foundations and core principles. The resource explores variables and essential data structures, programming concepts such as control flow, as well as functions, modules, and effective code structuring. Opportunities to learn the underlying concepts in Python and hands-on exercises with A&H textual data are provided.

By the end of this resource you are expected to be able to:

-   Implement core Python programming concepts, like variables, data structures and control flow.
-   Apply Python to process and analyse textual data in order to manage and extract information.
-   Build basic reusable Python scripts by using functions and modules for various tasks.

This resource is built with The Carpentries Workbench, as part of the training activities of the UKRI-funded Digital Skills in Arts and Humanities (DISKAH) Network.
